## Class Diagram
This class UML diagram shows the programmatic structures used to support the redbridge's **use cases** ([PlantUML](../Usecase/redbridge%20Usecases.wsd)/[image](../Usecase/redbridge%20Usecases.png)).

**Notes:** 

1. This class diagram is of a *specification* perspective, showing more detail than a *conceptual* class diagram but less than an *implementation* class diagram would show.
   
2. We are building the classes in light grey. The ones in darker grey are interfaces for existing components from external packages.
